# Project: Targeting Physicians for Epidural Steroidal Injection (ESI) Launch
A practical exploration of the pharmaceutical industry, involving in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis and the estimation of salesforce capacity.
## Project Overview

Our client, a growing pharmaceutical firm specializing in innovative pain management treatments, is preparing to launch the first FDA-approved Epidural Steroidal Injection (ESI) for lumbar pain. They require strategic guidance on:
